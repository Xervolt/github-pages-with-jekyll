        <h3>Anti-Drink Drive 酒死一生</h3>

Our task was to create a wall-painting for our military camp to promote anti-drink driving. Me and two comrades had a little more than two months to complete the painting. I initially thought we could do this until we began the actual draft. The difficulty of applying pencil marks onto the surface was phenomenal. Imagine drafting on a stone cladding covered by thick paint. Any errors we made became extremely unforgiving. Trying to block in lines was hard enough, but erasing takes it to a whole new level. As a result, the draft itself took us an entire week before completion.

The painting The painting stage was when things become a nightmare. Under minimal budget, we couldn’t afford anything but five buckets of student grade paint plus a few paintbrushes used at kindergartens. The bristle would get mixed into the paint as they fall apart so frequently. If that wasn’t hard enough, the rough surface took us triple the time to paint any area as we had to force the paint into those tiny holes of the surface.

<h4>How I got this photo:</h4>
        <p>
Trying to get this photo of the painting involved our company commander risking himself (all personal electrical devices were banned in the military). The only option was to borrow a local DSLR that’s used for shooting military events. I remember kindly asking our company commander(the highest position in a company) if he could take us a photo. It was on a good day as he strolled by to look at our painting. He looked relaxed. We were quite surprised he accepted our request. He was a nice guy compared to those of other companies. He told me that giving us the photo via USB would cause him serious trouble. There were security cameras installed intensively inside the PC room. The only solution was to have the images printed directly off the computer. Which is why the quality of the photo I’ve uploaded here is quite poor. The actual painting’s sky was less saturated.
